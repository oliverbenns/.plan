Inspired by the simplicity of John Carmack's [.plan files](https://github.com/oliverbenns/john-carmack-plan). [Sen](https://github.com/oliverbenns/sen) aims to create a minimalist blog for developers all within a Git repo. It prevents the need to worry about updates, style, management and longevity so they can focus purely on what's important: the message.
